<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.compress</em> can be used to compress and decompress
raster map layers. Additionally, it prints information about the
compression method and data type of the input raster map(s).

<p>
During (re-)compression, <em>r.compress</em> compresses raster maps 
using the method spcified with the environment variable 
<b>GRASS_COMPRESSOR</b>. The default is  ZLIB's "deflate" (LZ77-based) 
algorithm. Raster map layers which contain very little information 
(such as boundary, geology, soils and land use maps) can be greatly 
reduced in size. Some raster map layers are shrunk to roughly 1% of 
their original sizes. All newly generated raster maps are automatically 
stored in compressed form (see FORMATS below). All GRASS modules can 
read both compressed and uncompressed file formats.

<p>
As an example, the Spearfish data base raster map layer
<em>owner</em> was originally a size of 26600 bytes.  After
it was RLE compressed, the raster map became only 1249 bytes
(25351 bytes smaller).

<p>
Raster maps that are already compressed are again compressed. This is 
useful if either the compression method set with the environment 
variable <b>GRASS_COMPRESSOR</b> (RLE, ZLIB, LZ4, BZIP2) is changed or 
if the ZLIB compression level is manually changed by setting the 
environment variable GRASS_ZLIB_LEVEL.

<p>
Raster files may be decompressed manually to return them to their 
original format, using the <b>-u</b> flag of <em>r.compress</em>. If a 
raster map is already decompressed, it simply informs the user the map 
is already decompressed and exits.


<h3>TERMINOLOGY</h3>

<ul>
<li> INTEGER map (CELL data type): a raster map from INTEGER type (whole
  numbers only)</li>
<li> FLOAT map (FCELL data type): a raster map from FLOAT type (4 bytes,
  7-9 digits precision)</li>
<li> DOUBLE map (DCELL data type): a raster map from DOUBLE type (8 bytes,
  15-17 digits precision)</li>
<li> NULL: represents "no data" in raster maps, to be distinguished from
  0 (zero) data value</li>
</ul>

<h3>USED COMPRESSION ALGORITHMS</h3>
<!-- keep in sync with raster/rasterintro.html -->

Raster maps are by default ZLIB compressed. If the environment variable 
<tt>GRASS_INT_ZLIB</tt> exists and has the value 0, newly generated 
compressed integer (CELL type) raster maps will be compressed using RLE 
compression instead of ZLIB.
<p>
Floating point (FCELL, DCELL) raster maps never use RLE compression;
they are either compressed with ZLIB, LZ4, BZIP2 or are uncompressed.
<p>
The compression method for raster maps is by default ZLIB's deflate 
algorithm. The compression method can be set with the environment 
variable GRASS_COMPRESSOR which can be set to RLE, ZLIB, LZ4, or BZIP2.

<dl>
<dt><strong>RLE</strong></dt>
<dd><b>DEPRECATED</b> Run-Length Encoding, poor compression ratio but 
fast. Kept for backwards compatibility to read raster maps created with 
GRASS 6. Only used for raster maps of type CELL. FCELL and DCELL maps 
are never and have never been compressed with RLE.</dd>
<dt><strong>ZLIB</strong></dt>
<dd>ZLIB's deflate is the default compression method for all raster 
maps. GRASS 7 uses by default 1 as ZLIB compression level which is the 
best compromise betweeen speed and compression ratio, also when 
compared to other available compression methods. Valid levels are in 
the range [1, 9] and can be set with the environment variable 
GRASS_ZLIB_LEVEL.</dd>
<dt><strong>LZ4</strong></dt>
<dd>LZ4 is a very fast compression method, about as fast as no 
compression, decompression is also very fast. The compression ration is 
generally higher than for RLE. LZ4 is recommended if disk space is not 
a limiting factor, but some sving on disk space is welcomed without 
increasing processing speed. The compression ratio of LZ4 is generally 
better than for RLE but worse than for ZLIB.</dd>
<dt><strong>BZIP2</strong></dt>
<dd>BZIP2 can provide compression ratios much higher than for the other 
methods, but only for large raster maps (&gt; 10000 columns). For large 
raster maps, disk space consumption can be reduced by 30 - 50% when 
using BZIP2 instead of ZLIB's deflate. BZIP2 is the slowest compression 
and decompression method. However, if reading from / writing to a 
storage device is the limiting factor, BZIP2 compression can speed up 
raster map processing. Be aware that for smaller raster maps, BZIP2 
compression ratio can be worse than for other compression methods.</dd> 
</dl>

<p>
In the internal cellhd file, the value for "compressed" is 1 for RLE, 2 
for ZLIB, 3 for LZ4, and 4 for BZIP2.
<p>
Obviously, decompression is controlled by the raster map's compression,
not the environment variable.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

<em>r.compress</em> can be run either non-interactively or
interactively.  In non-interactive use, the user must
specify the name(s) of the raster map layer(s) to be
compressed (or decompressed) on the command line, using the
form <b>map=</b><em>name</em>[,<em>name</em>,...] (where
each <em>name</em> is the name of a raster map layer to be
compressed or decompressed). The default behavior is to 
compress the named map(s).  

<h3>FORMATS</h3>

Conceptually, a raster data file consists of rows of cells, with each 
row containing the same number of cells. A cell consists of one or more 
bytes. For CELL maps, the number of bytes per cell depends on the 
category values stored in the cell. Category values in the range 0-255 
require 1 byte per cell, while category values in the range 256-65535 
require 2 bytes, and category values in the range above 65535 require 3 
(or more) bytes per cell.
<p>
FCELL maps always have 4 bytes per cell and DCELL maps have always 8 
bytes per cell.

<p>
Since GRASS GIS 7.0.0, the default compression method for 
Integer (CELL) maps is ZLIB and not any more the RLE compression.

<h4>ZLIB compression level</h4>

If the environment variable <tt>GRASS_ZLIB_LEVEL</tt> exists and
its value can be parsed as an integer, it determines the compression
level used when newly generated raster maps are compressed using zlib
compression. This applies to all raster map types (CELL, FCELL, DCELL).
<p>
If the variable does not exist, or the value cannot be parsed as an
integer, zlib's default compression level will be used.


<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

r.compress compressed_RLE 
r.compress compressed_RLE -p 
  &lt;compressed_RLE&gt; is compressed (method 1: RLE). Data type: &lt;CELL&gt;
