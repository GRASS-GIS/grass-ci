<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.series.accumulate</em> calculates (accumulated) raster value 
using growing degree days (GDDs)/Winkler indices's, Biologically 
Effective Degree Days (BEDD), Huglin heliothermal indices or an average 
approach from several input maps.
<p>
The flag <b>-a</b> determines the average computation of the input raster maps. 
In case the flag is not set, the average calculation is:
<div class="code"><pre>
    average = (min + max) / 2
</pre></div>
In case the flag was set, the calculation changes to arithmetic mean
<div class="code"><pre>
    average = sum(input maps) / (number of input maps)
</pre></div>
<p>
<b>GDD</b> Growing Degree Days are calculated as
<div class="code"><pre>
    gdd = average - lower
</pre></div>
<p>
In case the <b>-a</b> is set, the Winkler indices are calculated instead
of GDD, usually accumulated for the period April 1<sup>st</sup> to October 
31<sup>st</sup> (northern hemisphere) or the period October 
1<sup>st</sup> to April 30<sup>th</sup> 
(southern hemisphere).
<p>
<b>BEDDs</b> Biologically Effective Degree Days are calculated as
<div class="code"><pre>
    bedd = average - lower
</pre></div>
with an optional upper <em>cutoff</em> applied to the average instead of 
the temperature values.
<p>
The <b>Huglin heliothermal index</b> is calculated as
<div class="code"><pre>
    huglin = (average + max) / 2 - lower
</pre></div>
usually accumulated for the period April 1<sup>st</sup> to September 
30<sup>th</sup> (northern hemisphere) or the period September 
1<sup>st</sup> to April 30<sup>th</sup> (southern hemisphere).
<p>
<b>Mean</b> raster values are calculated as
<div class="code"><pre>
    mean = average
</pre></div>
<p>
For all the formulas <em>min</em> is the minimum value, <em>max</em>
the maximum value and <em>average</em> the average value.
The <em>min</em>, <em>max</em> and <em>average</em> values
are automatically calculated from the input maps.
<p>
The <em>shift</em> and <em>scale</em> values are applied directly to 
the input values. The <em>lower</em> and <em>upper</em> maps, as well 
as the <em>range</em> options are applied to constrain the 
accumulation. In case the <em>lower</em> and <em>upper</em> maps are 
not provided the <em>limits</em> option with default values will be 
applied.
<p>
If an existing map is provided with the <em>basemap</em> option, the
values of this map are added to the output.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

The <em>scale</em> and <em>shift</em> parameters are used to transform 
input values with
<div class="code"><pre>
    new = old * scale + shift
</pre></div>
<p>
With the <em>-n</em> flag, any cell for which any of the 
corresponding input cells are NULL is automatically set to NULL 
(NULL propagation) and the accumulated value is not calculated.
<p>
Negative results are set to 0 (zero). 
<p>
Without the <em>-n</em> flag, all non-NULL cells are used for calculation.
<p>
If the <em>range=</em> option is given, any values which fall outside 
that range will be treated as if they were NULL. Note that the range is 
applied to the scaled and shifted input data. The <em>range</em> 
parameter can be set to <em>low,high</em> thresholds: 
values outside of this range are treated as NULL (i.e., they will be 
ignored by most aggregates, or will cause the result to be NULL if -n 
is given). The <em>low,high</em> thresholds are floating point, so use 
<em>-inf</em> or <em>inf</em> for a single threshold (e.g., 
<em>range=0,inf</em> to ignore negative values, or 
<em>range=-inf,-200.4</em> to ignore values above -200.4).
<p>
The number of input raster maps to be processed is given by the limit of the 
operating system. For example, both the hard and soft limits are 
typically 1024. The soft limit can be changed with e.g. 
<tt>ulimit -n 1500</tt> (UNIX-based operating systems) but not higher 
than the hard limit. If it is too low, you can as superuser add an 
entry in

<div class="code"><pre>
/etc/security/limits.conf
# &lt;domain&gt;      &lt;type&gt;  &lt;item&gt;         &lt;value&gt;
your_username  hard    nofile          1500
</pre></div>

This would raise the hard limit to 1500 file. Be warned that more
files open need more RAM. See also the Wiki page
<a href="http://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Large_raster_data_processing">Hints for large raster data processing</a>.
<p>
Use the <em>file</em> option to analyze large amount of raster maps 
without hitting open files limit and the size limit of command line 
arguments. The computation is slower than the <em>input</em> option 
method. For every sinlge row in the output map(s) all input maps are 
opened and closed. The amount of RAM will rise linear with the 
number of specified input maps. The input and file options are 
mutually exclusive. Input is a text file with a new line separated 
list of raster map names and optional weights. As separator between 
the map name and the weight the character "|" must be used.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

Example with MODIS Land Surface Temperature, transforming values from 
Kelvin * 50 to degrees Celsius:
<div class="code"><pre>
r.series.accumulate in=MOD11A1.Day,MOD11A1.Night,MYD11A1.Day,MYD11A1.Night out=MCD11A1.GDD \
      scale=0.02 shift=-273.15 limits=10,30
</pre></div>
