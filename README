How to get write access here?

Write access is only granted to developers who agree to abide by
RFC2 - Legal aspects of code contributions
 http://trac.osgeo.org/grass/wiki/RFC/2_LegalAspectsOfCodeContributions
and the code submission guidelines
 http://trac.osgeo.org/grass/wiki/Submitting

This needs to be communicated to a GRASS developer. S/he will 
then possibly propose you to the GRASS Project Steering committee
after a period of evaluation. For details, see
 http://trac.osgeo.org/grass/wiki/RFC

Once write access is granted, you, the new developer need to
obtain an "osgeo_id" at http://www.osgeo.org/osgeo_userid
If you already have an "osgeo_id" but forgot it, search for it at
Search at http://www.osgeo.org/cgi-bin/ldap_web_search.py

How to compile GRASS:
   See INSTALL file.

Yes, you should really read INSTALL.

How to generate the 'Programmer's Manual':

This needs doxygen (http://www.doxygen.org) and optionally
Graphviz dot (http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/).

To build the GRASS programmer's documentation, run
   make htmldocs
or to generate documentation as single html file (recommended for simple reading)
   make htmldocs-single
here. This takes quite some time. The result is in lib/html/index.html
which refers to further document repositories in
   lib/vector/html/index.html
   lib/db/html/index.html
   lib/gis/html/index.html

The master file is: ./grasslib.dox where all sub-documents have to
be linked into.

To generate the documents in PDF format, run
   make pdfdocs

An online version is available at:
http://grass.osgeo.org/programming7/

## Docker

Build using the downloaded source code (in the directory with the
source code):

    docker build -t grass .

A test run (assuming you have existing GRASS GIS location)

    docker run --rm -v /your/local/grassdata/:/data -it grass \
        grass /data/nc_basic_spm/PERMANENT --exec g.region -p

Note that the first `grass` is a name of the image while the second
`grass` is the name of the executable.

To run the tests (again assuming local location):

    docker run --rm -v /your/test/grassdata/:/data -w /code/grass \
        -it grass grass /data/nc_basic_spm/PERMANENT --exec \
            python -m grass.gunittest.main \
                --location nc_basic_spm --location-type nc
